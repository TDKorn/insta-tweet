The ``InstaTweet`` class
-------------------------

Not to be confused with the package, the :class:`InstaTweet` class is the main point of interaction for a user of
the package

*  It uses a fully configured :class:`~.Profile` to initialize an :class:`~.InstaClient` and :class:`~.TweetClient`, which
   are used to scrape and tweet posts when :meth:`~.start` is called
