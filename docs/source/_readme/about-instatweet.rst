Ever tried sharing an Instagram post to Twitter, only to find out that all you tweeted was a link, and not the actual photo/video?

        It could be literally anything, nobody will click it.

   That could be literally anything. Nobody will click it.



:class:`~.InstaTweet` **shares the** *actual* **content of the post. Not just a link to it.**

        It's a thicc cat, very handsome. Nobody will click the link, but they'll definitely see this bad boy.


With ``InstaTweet``, you can rest easy knowing that,
although nobody will click the link, they'll at least see what you posted.



What's InstaTweet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~.InstaTweet` is a customizable tool to automatically repost content from Instagram to Twitter.

Simply create a :class:`~.Profile`,
configure the :ref:`mandatory-settings`,
and :meth:`~.add_users` to repost from

.. code-block:: python

    from InstaTweet import Profile

    # Create a new (local) Profile
    >>> profile = Profile('myProfile')

    # Configure the required settings (at minimum)
    >>> profile.twitter_keys = twitter_api_keys
    >>> profile.session_id = '6011991A'

    # Add at least one Instagram account to repost from
    >>> profile.add_users('the.dailykitten')


Once configured, the :class:`~.Profile` can be used to initialize and
:meth:`~.start` an :class:`~.InstaTweet` object

.. code-block:: python

    from InstaTweet import InstaTweet

    # Directly initialize with the Profile from above
    >>> insta_tweet = InstaTweet(profile)

    # Or, save the Profile...
    >>> profile.save()

    Saved Local Profile myProfile

    # ...then InstaTweet.load() the settings in (by Profile name)
    >>> insta_tweet = InstaTweet.load(profile_name="myProfile")

    # Run InstaTweet by calling start()
    >>> insta_tweet.start()


.. admonition:: From the Docs...
    :class: docs

    .. automethod:: InstaTweet.instatweet.InstaTweet.start
        :noindex:


As ``InstaTweet`` runs, its progress will be logged to console:

.. code-block:: python

    Starting InstaTweet for Profile: myProfile
    Checking posts from @the.dailykitten
    ...
    Finished insta-tweeting for @the.dailykitten
    All users have been insta-tweeted


Okay... But Why? ðŸ˜Ÿ

   :class: instatweet

   **InstaTweet has two main use cases:**

   * To automatically share your own Instagram posts to Twitter
   * To automatically tweet new content from other Instagram users

   Regardless of your intention, InstaTweet will detect new posts from the users you specify, download them, and repost
   them to Twitter.
