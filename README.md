# InstaTweet
 A customizabe tool to automate reposting from Instagram to Twitter.
 

## What's InstaTweet?

InstaTweet is a tool that automatically tweets whenever there's a new post from a particular Instagram user. Add a list of Instagram usernames, an optional list of associated tweet hashtags for each user, and InstaTweet will take care of the rest.
 Save profiles to quickly switch between Twitter accounts and Instagram userlists. 

## Why?
InstaTweet has multiple use cases.

1. To automatically share your own Instagram posts to Twitter. 
   * Instagram currently has no native support for sharing reels to Twitter when posting. InstaTweet will automatically repost your reels to Twitter and allows you to define custom tweets for all posts
   

2. To automatically tweet new content from other Instagram users
   * For example, the owner of a fan acount could configure InstaTweet to scrape multiple Instagram users. They can then be one of the first to tweet when there's new content in their fandom.    

Personally, I have 1.4 million followers on Instagram but only 1 follower on Twitter (it's my brother). I made InstaTweet as a project to see if I can build a following on Twitter by simply reposting from my Instagram account.
